  <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>Hi, I'm Rousseau Sade — a passionate self-taught learner who thrives at the intersection of technology, creativity, and critical thinking.<br>
      I love programming, reading obsessively, writing, drawing, learning languages, and immersing myself in imaginary worlds through games and stories.</p>
    
    <p>I'm currently training as a Full Stack Developer, combining hands-on personal projects with structured learning through platforms like Udemy. <br>
      I have experience building automation tools with Python, especially for administrative and data-related tasks, and I’m comfortable working with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
      I'm driven by the idea of using software not just to build, but to solve real problems and make life easier for others.</p>

    <p>I'm passionate about languages and have foundations in German, French, Portuguese, Italian, and Catalan. <br>
      I'm fueled by curiosity and a constant desire to understand how things work — whether it's a system, a language, or a society.</p>

    <p>I'm not chasing perfection — I'm committed to progress. I make mistakes, I learn, and I move forward, because I know every step, <br>
      even the uncertain ones, brings me closer to who I want to become.</p>

  <strong><p>Thanks for reading</p></strong>
